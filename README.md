## PX4 SiTL with Geometric Control

Instead of sending offboard commands from a companion computer, this repo replaces the cascaded PID controllers of PX4 Autopilot with a customized model-based geometric controller for quadrotors. 

Note: This breaks quite a few PX4 abstractions and may need significant tuning before applying to a real drone.
